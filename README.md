Scripts, Reg Files, and NTLite configs to debloat, fix, and optimize Windows....especially the headache that is Windows 11. Please note that most of these optimizations are for if you have a RTX Nvidia card, alot of the registry changes are specifically for those because of different driver registry locations to GTX Nvidia cards.

Recommended Apps to download:
NTLite (premium is a necessity and worth every penny)- Tool to make custom Windows ISO's to debloat, customize your OS, alter online images, and remove any reinstalled bloat from an update

Nilesoft Shell- make custom context menus (especially useful for replacing Windows 11's completely useless context menu and adding some flare)

GoInterruptPolicy- reduce latency and stutter by turning on MSI mode for drivers, associating which cores drivers are gonna be using, and change priorities

O&O Shut Up 10- tell Windows to Shut Up, stop spying, and killing perf for no reason

NVCleanstall- debloat Nvidia drivers to combat DPC latency, audio stutter, and lag in general

LatencyMon- pretty much benchmarking how much lag is in your system, test changes, help troubleshoot, and point out problem areas.
