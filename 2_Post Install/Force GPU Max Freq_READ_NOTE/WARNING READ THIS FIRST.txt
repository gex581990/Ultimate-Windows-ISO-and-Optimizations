Warning! This will disable Dynamic P States on your gpu. You will be at your gpu's max frequency until it gets close to max temp then will slowly drop voltage and frequency.

If your GPU's cooling is poor you should skip this

If you have a high performer and don't mind tweaking in overclocking software then this give you max perf consistently.

Since there isn't so many fluctuations in frequency this will also help with latency making things consistent.

It doesn't make sense to always be at max when you aren't even doing anything tho so I recommend using GPU overclocking software like GPUtweak
or Msi Afterburner to lock your voltage/freq at a much lower setting when you aren't doing something GPU intensive so you can keep your temps down and not have unnecessary wear and tear.
